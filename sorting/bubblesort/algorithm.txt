Bubble sort

Bubble sort is based on the idea of repeatedly comparing pairs of adjacent elements
and then swapping their positions if they exist in the wrong order

1. Iterate through the list.
2. Compare two elements at a time and swap if not in order.
3. Repeat 2 until all elements are sorted.

Pseudo code

for(i=0;i<input.len-1;i++)
{
  for(j=0,j<input.len-i-1,j++)
  {
    if(input[j]>input[j+1])
    {
      swap(input[j],input[j+1])
    }
  }
}


Complexity:
Time: O(n^2)

Sort order: Inplace
